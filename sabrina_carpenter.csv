Song,Lyrics
Please Please Please,"I know I have good judgment, I know I have good taste
It's funny and it's ironic that only I feel that way
I promise 'em that you're different and everyone makes mistakes
But just don't
I heard that you're an actor, so act like a stand-up guy
Whatever devil's inside you, don't let him out tonight
I tell them it's just your culture and everyone rolls their eyes
Yeah, I know
All I'm asking, baby
Please, please, please
Don't prove I'm right
And please, pleasе, please
Don't bring me to tеars when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing, my ego's another
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please 
Well, I have a fun idea, babe , maybe just stay inside
I know you're cravin' some fresh air, but the ceiling fan is so nice 
And we could live so happily if no one knows that you're with me
I'm just kidding, but really , really, really
Please, please, please 
Don't prove I'm right
And please, please, please
Don't bring me to tears when I just did my makeup so nice
Heartbreak is one thing , my ego's another 
I beg you, don't embarrass me, motherfucker, oh
Please, please, please 
If you wanna go and be stupid
Don't do it in front of me
If you don't wanna cry to my music
Don't make me hate you prolifically
Please, please, please 
Please, please, please 
Please , please , please"
Bed Chem,"I was in a sheer dress the day that we met
We were both in a rush, we talked for a sec
Your friend hit me up so we could connect
And what are the odds? You send me a text
And now the next thing I know, I'm like
Manifest that you're oversized
I digress, got me scrollin' like
Out of breath, got me goin' like
Ooh 
Who's the cute boy with the white jacket and the thick accent? Like
Ooh 
Maybe it's all in my head
But I bеt we'd have really good bеd chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed  chem 
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good
Come right on me, I mean camaraderie
Said you're not in my time zone, but you wanna be
Where art thou? Why not uponeth me?
See it in my mind, let's fulfill the prophecy
Ooh 
Who's the cute guy with the wide blue eyes and the big bad mm? Like
Ooh 
I know I sound a bit redundant
But I bet we'd have really good bed chem
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round
Oh, it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things 
That's bed chem 
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed 
Are you free next week?
I bet we'd have really good 
And I bet we'd both arrive at the same time 
And I bet the thermostat's set at six-nine 
And I bet it's even better than in my head 
How you pick me up, pull 'em down, turn me 'round 
Oh, it just makes sense 
How you talk so sweet when you're doin' bad things
That's bed chem 
How you're lookin' at me, yeah, I know what that means
And I'm obsessed 
Are you free next week? 
I bet we'd have really good
Ha

No-no-no
Ha

No-no-no, no, oh no, oh
Ha

No-no-no, oh

Ooh, oh, baby"
Juno,"Don't have to tell your hot ass a thing
Oh yeah, you just get it
Whole package, babe, I like the way you fit
God bless your dad's genetics, mm, uh
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night, I'm thinking 'bout you, ah-ah
Wanna try out my fuzzy pink handcuffs?
Oh, I hear you knockin', baby, come on up
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love 
I showed my friends, then we high-fived 
Sorry if you feel objеctified 
Can't help myself, hormonеs are high
Give me more than just some butterflies
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Oh, late at night, I'm thinking 'bout you, ah-ah
Wanna try out some freaky positions?
Have you ever tried this one?
I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love
Adore me
Hold me and explore me
Mark your territory 
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one 
Adore me
Hold me and explore me 
I'm so fuckin' horny
Tell me I'm the only, only, only, only one
Ah
Ooh-ooh
 I know you want my touch for life
If you love me right, then who knows?
I might let you make me Juno
You know I just might 
Let you lock me down tonight
One of me is cute, but two though?
Give it to me, baby
You make me wanna make you fall in love"
Taste,"Oh, I leave quite an impression
Five feet to be exact
You're wonderin' why half his clothes went missin'
My body's where they're at
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do
Just know you'll taste me too
Uh-huh
He pins you down on the carpet
Makes paintings with his tongue
 
Hе's funny now, all his jokes hit different
Guеss who he learned that from?
Now I'm gone, but you're still layin'
Next to me, one degree of separation
I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do 
Just know you'll taste me too
La-la-la-la-la-la-la
Every time you close your eyes
And feel his lips, you're feelin' mine
And every time you breathe his air
Just know I was already there
You can have him if you like
I've been there, done that once or twice
And singin' 'bout it don't mean I care
Yeah, I know I've been known to share
Well, I heard you're back together and if that's true
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
If you want forever, and I bet you do 
Just know you'll taste me too
Taste me too, ow 
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you
You, no, yeah, ah-ah 
You'll just have to taste me when he's kissin' you"
Espresso,"Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
I can't relate to desperation
My give-a-fucks are on vacation
And I got this one boy and he won't stop calling
When they act this way, I know I got 'em
 Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
 Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
 Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya
 I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
 That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
 One touch and I brand-newed it for ya 
And now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Holy shit
Is it that sweet? I guess so 
I'm working late 'cause I'm a singer
Oh, he looks so cute wrapped 'round my finger
My twisted humor make him laugh so often
My honeybee, come and get this pollen
 Too bad your ex don't do it for ya
 Walked in and dream-came-trued it for ya
 Soft skin and I perfumed it for ya 
 I know I Mountain Dew it for ya
 That morning coffee, brewed it for ya
 One touch and I brand-newed it for ya 
Now he's thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Move it up, down, left, right, oh
Switch it up like Nintendo
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso 
Thinkin' 'bout me every night, oh
Is it that sweet? I guess so 
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso 
Move it up, down, left, right, oh 
Switch it up like Nintendo 
Say you can't sleep, baby, I know
That's that me espresso
Is it that sweet? I guess so
Mm, that's that me espresso"
Skin,"Maybe we could've been friends
If I met you in another life
Maybe then we could pretend
There's no gravity in the words we write
Maybe you didn't mean it
Maybe ""blonde"" was the only rhyme
The only rhyme
Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine, oh
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While hе's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that еven you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in
You're tellin' it how you see it
Like truth is whatever you decide
Some people will believe it
And some will read in between the lines
You're putting me in the spotlight
But I've been under it all my life
Said all my life
Want my heart to be breakin', breakin', no
I'm happy and you hate it, hate it, oh
And I'm not asking you to let it go
But you been tellin' your side
So I'll be tellin' mine 
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in, oh
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in, oh
I just hope that one day
We both can laugh about it
When it's not in our face
Won't have to dance around it
Don't drive yourself insane
It won't always be this way
You can try
To get under my, under my, under my skin
While he's on mine
Yeah, all on my, all on my, all on my skin
I wish you knew that even you
Can't get under my skin if I don't let you in"
Good Graces,"Oh, mm
Mm
When I love you, I'm sweet like an angel
Drawin' hearts 'round our names
And dreamin' of writing vows, rockin' cradles
Don't mistake my nice for naive
I don't waste a second, I know lots of guys
You do somethin' suspect, this cute ass bye-bye
Like, ooh
Baby, you say you really like it being mine?
So let me give you some advice
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces
Or I'll switch it up like that  so fast 
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
That was cool
I won't give a fuck about you 
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
Yeah
I'll tell the world you finish your chores prematurely
Break my heart and I swear I'm movin' on
With your favorite athlete
Shoot his shot every night
Want you every second, don't need other guys
You do somethin' sus, kiss my cute ass bye
Boy, it's not that complicated
You should stay in my good graces 
Or I'll switch it up like that so fast
'Cause no one's more amazin' 
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
Boy, it's not that complicated 
You should stay in my good graces 
Or I'll switch it up like that  so fast 
'Cause no one's more amazin'
At turnin' lovin' into hatred
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
Oh, no
I won't give a fuck about you 
I won't give a fuck about you
I won't give a fuck about you
Oh
No, I won't
I won't give a fuck about you, no, I won't
No, I won't
I won't give a fuck about you, no, I won't"
Slim Pickins,"Guess I'll end this life alone
I am not dramatic
These are just the thoughts that pass right through me
All the douchebags in my phone
Play 'em like a slot machine
If they're winnin', I'm just losin'
A boy who's jacked and kind
Can't find his ass to save my life
Oh, it's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Ah-ah-ah-ah
Jesus, what's a girl to do?
This boy doesn't even know
The difference between ""there,"" ""their"" and ""they are""
Yet he's naked in my room
Missin' all the things he's missin'
God knows that he isn't livin' large
A boy who's nice that breathes
I swear he's nowhere to be seen
It's slim pickings
If I can't have the one I love
I guess it's you that I'll be kissin'
Just to get my fixings
Since the good ones are deceased or taken
I'll just keep on moanin' and bitchin'
Moanin' and bitchin'
Since the good ones call their exes wasted
And since the Lord forgot my gay awakenin'
Then I'll just be here in the kitchen
Servin' up some moanin' and bitchin'"
Sharpest Tool,"I know you're not
The sharpest tool in the shed
We had sex, I met your best friends
Then a bird flies by and you forget
I don't hear a word
'Til your guilt creeps in
On a Tuesday, send a soft ""hey""
As if you really don't recall the time
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we'rе fine
You're confused and I'm upsеt, but
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
We never talk about it
All the silence just makes it worse, really
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
All the silence is just your strategy
'Cause it leaves you so top-of-mind for me
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out
, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh
We were goin' right, then you took a left
Left me with a lot of shit to second-guess
Guess I'll waste another year on wonderin' if
If that was casual, then I'm an idiot
I'm lookin' for an answer in-between the lines
Lyin' to yourself if you think we're fine
You're confused and I'm upset, but
We never talk about it 
We never talk about it 
We never talk about it 
We never talk about how you
Found God at your ex's house, always
Made sure that the phone was face-down
Seems like overnight, 
I'm just the bitch you hate now
We never talk it through
How you guilt-tripped me to open up to you
Then you logged out, leavin' me dumbfounded, oh-oh
We don't talk about it
, we don't talk about it 
We don't talk about it, talk, talk, talk about it 
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it 
We don't talk about it, we don't talk about it"
Dumb And Poetic,"You're so dumb and poetic
It's just what I fall for, I like the aesthetic
Every self-help book, you've already read it
Cherry-pick lines like they're words you invented
Gold star for highbrow manipulation
And ""love everyone"" is your favorite quotation
Try to come off like you're soft and well-spoken
Jack off to lyrics by Leonard Cohen
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you talk like one doesn't make you a man
You're so sad there's no communication
But, baby, you put us in this situation
You're running so fast from the hearts that you're breakin'
Save all your breath for your floor meditation
You're so empathetic, you'd make a great wife
And I promise the mushrooms aren't changing your life
Well, you crashed the car and abandoned the wreckage
Fuck with my head like it's some kind of fetish
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you act like one doesn't make you a man
Don't think you understand
Just 'cause you leave like one doesn't make you a man"
